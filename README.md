The Haukai Restaurant web application

ACCESSIBILITY GUIDELINES:
The <h1> heading is larger than all of the other headings. The <h2> headings are smaller than the <h1> headings but larger than the <h3> heading used. 
All of the images used have an appropriate and descriptive alt text
Minimal use of colour. Colour that was used to overlay images was overlayed in a way that is large enough that it is easy to read.
Colour used in a way that should not make it too difficult for people with colour-blindness to read
Navigational menu options spread wide enough not to create issues.
Keyboard able to be used to access different navigational menu options and can be used to access Google form used for bookings and to change the dates that are showing the in the Google calendar. Can also scroll using the up and down arrow keys
ARIA roles and landmarks used to identify the main content of the web pages, the navigational menu and the banners/headers in the web pages.
I also made sure to use text overlays over the images for the banner rather than first editing the text onto the image and using the image that has the text on it.
The layout of the website also remains the same on each page rather than changing entirely on each page.
