The Haukai Restaurant web application

ACCESSIBILITY GUIDELINES:
The "h1" heading is larger than all of the other headings. The "h2" headings are smaller than the "h1" headings but larger than the "h3" heading used. 
All of the images used have an appropriate and descriptive alt text
Minimal use of colour. Colour that was used to overlay images was overlayed in a way that is large enough that it is easy to read.
Colour used in a way that should not make it too difficult for people with colour-blindness to read
Navigational menu options spread wide enough not to create issues.
Keyboard able to be used to access different navigational menu options and can be used to access Google form used for bookings and to change the dates that are showing the in the Google calendar. Can also scroll using the up and down arrow keys
ARIA roles and landmarks used to identify the main content of the web pages, the navigational menu and the banners/headers in the web pages.
I also made sure to use text overlays over the images for the banner rather than first editing the text onto the image and using the image that has the text on it.
The layout of the website also remains the same on each page rather than changing entirely on each page. 

RESPONSIVE DESIGN PRINCIPLES:
Horizontal scrolling is not necessary to see all of the content on the page.
Viewport scaling has been added to allow the size of content to update based on the size of the device's viewport. 
Image sizes scale with the page size and viewport size. 
Font sizes are legible for both mobile and desktop devices. 

ROLE OF HTTP CACHING AND CONTENT DELIVERY NETWORKS:
Web caching would increase the responsiveness of the web application by allowing the web page to load faster. This would be done by allowing the browser to keep a copy of the previously loaded website locally. This will mean that if the web server has not changed then the download speed and responsiveness of the website will increase significantly. 
Content Delivery Networks (assuming this is the same as Content Distribution Networks) use caches located around the world to increase the responsiveness of web applications. Content delivery networks work by playing caches around the world in areas where users might be located and place content within the spread out caches. This allows people in different parts of the world who are trying to access the same web page to have the same download speed and response time from a website. This would increase the responsiveness of the web application by reducing download times to retrieve a copy of a web page. By having caches in different areas of the world, it means people do not have to use a cache that is very far from where they are to access a webpage. This means the travel time of the data packets is reduced. This also increases the responsiveness of the web page.
